              <p>
				<b>FAMILY COUNSELLING CENTRE & SHORT STAY SHELTER HOME </b><br><br>
                The Sahodari Family Counselling Centre of YWCA Madras is funded by the Central Social Welfare Board and monitored by the Tamil Nadu Widows and Deserted Women Welfare Board. The Sahodari Project was started in 1986 to provide a space for women seeking safety and shelter from violence and abuse. Since then, women have been approaching Sahodari to find a safe space from the violence within their families and communities. Sahodari provides a temporary shelter for women of all ages, irrespective of their religion, caste, class, ethnicity, and language.  
				<br><br>
               The project also collaborates with the local All-Women Police Stations, which are often the first point of contact for women affected by violence.

              <p>
				The Counsellors of the Project have access to spaces in the police station so that they will have first contact with victims and are able to provide counselling and safe support to women affected by violence. The counsellors are present to immediately take over the protection with a non-judgmental attitude and unconditional support for women affected by domestic or other forms of violence. There are also many cases of women and young girls running away from their homes to escape violence.<br><br>
				Women come to Sahodari from different states, speaking different languages. When they come to Sahodari, they are referred to as’ clients ‘to maintain their dignity. They are immediately taken in and given a change of clothes, water, food, and a place to sleep, feeling safe. From then, the project team will offer counselling services and trace the family to include them in the counselling sessions if the client wishes it. In most cases, the rehabilitation process is long, and many women come in a very stressed and unbalanced state of mind.<br><br>
				Many women require legal support, especially in very abusive relationships where the abusive partner or person continues to stalk the victim. In such instances, the Project team requires police action and judicial orders to restrain such persons from contacting the client. The counsellors are also members of the local government' Social Welfare Board and have access to family court lawyers and government protection programmes. Sahodari also provides a safe and non-judgmental space for women to resolve their family disputes in an atmosphere of reconciliation and understanding. It also provides emergency short-stay shelter, rehabilitation services, medical assistance, police assistance, legal assistance, and referral services.<br><br>
				The Sahodari Family Counselling Centre is managed by a Project committee of volunteers and a project team of Counsellors and housemothers. The Project team reports to the Executive General Secretary of the organisation. The project committee is headed by a Chairperson who is a member of the Board of Management who monitors the project and keeps track of its progress. The Counsellors are all qualified Masters in Social Work (MSW) who are trained and certified Counsellors.<br><br>
